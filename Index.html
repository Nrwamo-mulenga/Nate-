      <h1 id=Blue-text>Air pollution</h1>
      <p id=Purple-text>Air pollution is the leading cause to global warming in my opinion we should try and stop it because if we contiue we will be contributing to a problem that we are trying to solve and by doing that our world as we know it will never be the same. </p>

      <h1 id=green-text>Solution to this big problem</h1>
      <p>The solution to solve Global Warming should be taken personally so that we can solve the whole problem, For example we should stop using cars that use gas and start to use cars that use electricity, because the more that we use cars that use gas we are contributing to global warming.</p>
